# CommUnity

LegalFamily's "parcel tracking" for patients.

Built on technology so bleeding edge we've got the scars to prove it.

## Features (or "ToDo")

* Location-restricted security.
* Live database backend (Google Firebase looks promising; problem with Elm integration?)
* Extensible plugin architecture for importing/syncing data with diverse systems.

## Adoption

* Threats/obstacles:
    * "Dogma" re existing systems.
    * Siloed data.
* Opportunities:
    * User-unfriendliness (of Trakcare).
    * Unification could reduce wasted time, lost "bed days".
    * Pressures/trends to open data silos (c.f OpenBanking).
    * Hook power user early adopters via customisable, extensible.
    * Regional fragmentation allows a foot in the door.
* Strengths:
    * Mobile-first.  EMR on the move.  No more COWs (computers on wheels).
    * Uses robust and efficient functional programming.
* Weaknesses:
    * No good story on unified back end.
    
## Dependencies

You'll need node (nodejs) via brew or apt-get or whatever.

* `elm-package install elm-lang/Http`
* `elm-package install debois/elm-mdl`

## Run me

Run `elm-reactor` in this directory.  It'll serve some webbystuff on `localhost:8000`.  On that page, navigate to `index.html`

## Data

Update the autogenerated data files (`PatientList.elm`, `JobList.elm`... maybe others in future) by running `./fakedata.py` *in* `./tools'.
